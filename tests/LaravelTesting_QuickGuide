This file contains information on how to write integration test cases within 
Laravel framework.

Key Concepts
1. Laravel integration testing uses phpunit.
2. phpunit can execute all tests under the tests directory or
3. phpunit can execute a specific test case.
4. To run all tests under /tests directory, do
    <path_to_phpunit_executable> tests
5. to run a specific test, do
    <path_to_phpunit_executable> <path_to_test>/test_name.php
6. Each test case is a php class file and extends TestCase
7. To navigate to application root, use
    ->visit('/')
8. To assert that a text is displayed anywhere in the page, use
    ->see('Musicians Manager')
9. To submit a form, use
    ->submitForm('Login', ['username' => 'xxx', 'password' => 'yyy'])
